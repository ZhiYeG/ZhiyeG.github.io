I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at the University of Missouri. I obtained my B.S. and M.S. in Electrical Engineering at University of Xiamen, China. I was a software inter at Xiamen Weixintai Technology Co.,Ltd. During college, I was a member of the RCS Robot Team of Xiamen University, where I met many interesting people and established my future direction

<font size=5>Research</font> 

My current research interests include machine learning, deep learning, computational biology. I have developed protein complex distance predition tool [CDPred](https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/CDPred), protein intra-chain distance prediction tool [DeepDist](https://github.com/multicom-toolbox/deepdist), and protein secondary structure prediction tool [DNSS2](https://github.com/multicom-toolbox/DNSS2). In addition, I have a strong interest in computer vision and machine vision, and I have some experience in the design and production of robots.
